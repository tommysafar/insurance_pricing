Overview

This project involves developing a price estimator that predicts the lowest price offered by a panel of insurers for a given set of input circumstances. The dataset provided consists of insurance quotes from multiple insurers, where each unique QuoteID corresponds to a specific set of circumstances.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes various input features that describe the circumstances under which a quote was generated.
Multiple insurers provide quotes for each QuoteID, often with different payment methods and frequencies.
The target variable for this task is TotalAmountPayable, representing the total cost of a given insurance quote.
Task Objective

The objective is to build a model that can predict the lowest available price for a given set of quote input circumstances. This involves:

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant input variables that influence pricing.
Data Processing: Filtering and structuring the dataset for modeling.
Model Development: Choosing an appropriate algorithm to estimate the lowest price effectively.
Evaluation: Demonstrating the accuracy and effectiveness of the model using appropriate validation metrics.
